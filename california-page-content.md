From marine layer mornings in San Francisco to triple-digit heat in Palm Springs, indoor golf simulators offer the perfect climate-controlled alternative.

According to the National Golf Foundation, 48.1 million Americans played golf in some form during 2024, with 19 million choosing off-course options like simulators. California leads this trend, with indoor facilities expanding rapidly across the state. Whether you're looking to escape August heat in Riverside or find a fog-proof practice session in Half Moon Bay, indoor golf delivers consistent conditions 365 days a year.
