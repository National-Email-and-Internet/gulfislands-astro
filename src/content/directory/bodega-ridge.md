  Bodega Ridge is a place to slow down and feel the landscape around you. Forest meets rocky shoreline, the sky opens up, and nights tend to end with stargazing. This is West Coast comfort in a flannel jacket.
  
  Seven rustic log cabins are situated on a 22-acre property beautifully surrounded by arbutus trees and wildflowers. 
  
  **Dining:**  
  Dine at Lola with a menu created by Chef Elmark Andres, and refuel at The Pink Geranium Café and General Store.
  
  Perfect for retreats, destination weddings, and corporate getaways.
